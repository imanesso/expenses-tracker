            <h1>Welcome to the Expenses Tracker</h1>
            <p>This application is used to track expenses and to categorize them. It can bring light into the darkness of your daily expenses.</p>
            <p>There’s no reason to be ashamed of it: most people in the world don’t track expenses...</p>

            <h1>Why track your expenses?</h1>
            <h3>#1 Know where your money goes</h3>
            <p>It’s a first advantage of deciding to track expenses: knowing exactly where all your hard-earned cash is ending up.</p>

            <h3>#2 Become more organised and disciplined</h3>
            <p>When you’ve learnt where your expenses are going and what your priorities are, you’ll naturally become more and more disciplined in your expenditures.
            It’ll be hard at the beginning, as all good things are, but soon you’ll find yourself getting into a routine. Discipline is only necessary as a start—after that it’s routine.
            </p>
            <p>This discipline might eventually make you a better human being</p>

            <h3>#3 Prevent a certain crisis</h3>
            <p>When you do track expenses, you’ll see where those dangerous areas are.</p>
