<section title="About">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This application can be used to track your daily expenses. It was created for the FHNW module webec</p>
</section>
<section title="Content">
    <h2>General Project Description</h2>
    <p>The expense tracker is used to track expenses and to categorise them.
        The web-application also has role based security which allows different things for the admins and normal users</p>
    <p>I seeded some default data to make it easier to test after a start in the file <code>Bootstrap.groovy</code>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User: admin, password: admin</li>
        <li>User: test, password: test</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Project Satisfaction</h3>
    <p>I have never worked with Grails before and I am not very experienced in web development. I struggled at first, but after a while I started to like it</p>
    <p>I could not finish everything the way I wanted, because I struggled with the time. In the beginning I wanted to export the monthly statement to pdf, but I just couldn't make it work, so I reverted it completely.
        But overall I am happy that I have a functioning solution.
    </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>

    <h5>Role Admin</h5>
    <p>This is how a navigation bar of an admin looks like</p>

    <p>Users with the role admin can create new users and categories additionally to all the functions that a normal user has.
        They can also see the expenses of all users in a parent-child view when they click on the user to show them.</p>
