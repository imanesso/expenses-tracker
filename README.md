## General Project Description
The expense tracker is used to track expenses and to categorise them. The web-application also has role based security which allows different things for the admins and normal users


## Project satisfaction
I have never worked with Grails before and I am not very experienced in web development. I struggled at first, but after a while I started to like it

I could not finish everything the way I wanted, because I struggled with the time. In the beginning I wanted to export the monthly statement to pdf, but I just couldn't make it work, so I reverted it completely. But overall I am happy that I have a functioning solution. 

## Project delivery

I seeded some default data to make it easier to test after a start in the file Bootstrap.groovy.
